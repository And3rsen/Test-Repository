# Test-Repository

Hello. My name is Andersen and I'm an incoming freshman at Stony Brook University as a computer science major. I don't know exactly what my future career will be. Maybe I will write code for a robot, go into machine learning, cybersecurity, or something else. However, I do know that GitHub will be critical for me to share my code with others. My future interviewer will most likely ask me for my GitHub. This is why I want to learn to transfer code to and from GitHub, and gain enough experience to be able to work effectively. It's almost guaranteed that I will use GitHub for class projects in college and possibly internships. One day, you will be able to play some of the games I made with Python, once I upload them to GitHub.
